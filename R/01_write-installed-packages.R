## deja vu from yesterday!
library(tidyverse)
## create a data frame of your installed packages
(myPkg <- installed.packages() %>%
  tbl_df() %>%
  select(Package,LibPath,Version,Priority,Built))
## keep the variables
##   * Package
##   * LibPath
##   * Version
##   * Priority
##   * Built

write_csv(myPkg,path = here("data","installed-packages.csv"))
## write it to data/installed-packages.csv
## YES overwrite the file that is there now
## that came from me (Jenny)
## it an example of what yours should look like

## when this script works, stage & commit it and the csv file
## PUSH!
